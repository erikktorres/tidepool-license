# web-skeleton

This is a docpad static site primed to be consistent with Tidepool's
web style guidelines.

This is meant as a starting point to discuss how re-usable components
should present themselves on the web.

## Install

Re-use the skeleton like this:
```bash
docpad skeleton https://github.com/tidepool-org/web-skeleton.git
```
