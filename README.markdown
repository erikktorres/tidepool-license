This is a docpad installation of Tidepool's Tidepool License so that people who want to use it can do so in the context of github's editing and forking features.

If you just want to view the document in context, you can do so [here](http://tidepool-org.github.io/tidepool-license/).


## Install

If you want to propose edits to the license text, you can fork this repository and offer a pull request against the text found in src/documents/index.html.md. It's a rather simple markdown document. You can preview it in rough form using your favorite markdown previewer (on a Mac, [Marked](http://marked2app.com) is pretty good.)

If you wish to run and display the document from your own local copy of the repository, you'll need to get docpad running. You can do that by following the directions at [docpad.org](http://docpad.org/).
